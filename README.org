* Theme Faves Emacs (a work in progress)

** What its for?

 - Theme Faves works with color-theme to provide a rapid way of
   switching between and selecting favourite themes
 - Note: I can't take the credit for having written any of the
   audition themes

** Features

 - Single key or chord stroke switching between unlimited favourite themes
 - Easy selection of new favourites from over 150 themes
 - Easy deletion of favourites
 - Easy generation of new theme templates from favourites

** Other theme switchers

There are other theme switchers out there such as xxx which may be
more suitable than Theme Faves, but this fairly simple system scratched an
itch for me

** TODO Setup

(add-to-path 'load-path (concat dotfile-dir "theme-faves"))
(require 'theme-faves)
(add-hook 'window-setup-hook 'theme-faves-init)

** TODO Key-bindings

My setup is as follows...

 - Favourite theme cycling bound to f7
   - (global-set-key [f7] 'theme-faves-cycle)
 - All theme cycling bound to C-f7
   - (global-set-key [C-f7] 'theme-faves-audition-cycle)

The following functions  aren't currently bound to keys since they
aren't used very often...

 - M-x theme-faves-save 
   - Save currently auditioned theme to favourites
 - M-x theme-faves-delete
   - Delete currently displayed theme from favourites 
 - M-x theme-faves-create 
   - TODO Create template theme from this favourite for future modification

** TODO Improvements

 - Finish and test properly
   - Currently only tested with color-theme-6.6.0 on linux
 - Implement reverse cycling for S-f7 and S-C-f7 (I think these
   bindings are possible?)
