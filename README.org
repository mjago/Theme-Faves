* Theme Faves Emacs (a work in progress)

** What its for?

 - Theme Faves works with [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorTheme][color-theme]] to provide a rapid way of
   switching between and selecting favourite themes
   - (themes provided by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorTheme][color-theme]] - add to these at will)

** Features

 - Single key or chord stroke switching between unlimited favourite
   themes
 - Easy selection of new favourites from over 150 themes
 - Easy deletion of favourites
 - Easy generation of new theme templates from favourites
 - To reverse favourites or audition cycle direction hold down shift

** Other theme switchers

   Other theme switchers exist and may be checked out [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorTheme][here]]

** TODO Setup
*** I have used the F7 key for theme cycling here
 - Favourites cycling on F7
 - Favourites reverse cycling on Shift-F7
 - Audition cycling on Control-F7
 - Audition reverse cycling on Shift-Control-F7

#+BEGIN_SRC

(add-to-path 'load-path (concat dotfile-dir "theme-faves"))
(require 'theme-faves)
(add-hook 'window-setup-hook 'theme-faves-init)

** Other functions

The following functions  are not currently bound to keys since they
aren't used very often...

 - M-x theme-faves-save 
   - Save currently auditioned theme to favourites
 - M-x theme-faves-delete
   - Delete currently displayed theme from favourites 
 - M-x theme-faves-create 
   - TODO Create template theme from this favourite for future modification

** TODO Improvements

 - Finish and test properly
   - Currently only tested with color-theme-6.6.0 on linux
 - Implement reverse cycling for S-f7 and S-C-f7 (I think these
   bindings are possible?)
